# Important_Activities_Reminder_Application

Nowadays during WFH, we usually don't follow a proper schedule. Don't eat on time, barely get up and drink in between our office work/while coding. It affects our health a lot.
There's a cool solution to this problem i.e.
To create an application which will remind us of important activities like drinking water, having lunch, snacks etc by sending notifications on the laptop.
Hence, I tried implementing it. :p

**Testing the code**

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python activity_reminder.py
```
