# Important_Activities_Reminder_Application

- While working on our laptops, we usually don't keep an eye on time. :(
- We barely get up and drink water, have lunch/snacks on proper time and tend to miss it. On a serious note, it affects our health in so many bad ways! 
- There exists a cool technical solution to this problem:
- And that is to create an application which will remind us of important activities like drinking water, having lunch, snacks etc by sending notifications on the laptop.
  Hence, I tried implementing it. :p

**So, Hey! Let's run the code**

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python activity_reminder.py
```
